EnMAS Depends on SBT (simple build tool)

From within the EnMAS-quickstart directory, issue the command:

sbt run

The first time you run SBT, it will install all of its own dependencies and set up your local ivy repository if it doesn't exist.  

Next SBT will read the build.sbt file in this directory and download all of the dependencies for EnMAS.

Finally, SBT will search the classpath for Main methods.  In this project, there are three programs to choose from:

- Server
- Client
- Bundler

In order to run experiments there needs to be at least one instance each of ServerManager and ClientManager running on two computers that can reach each other on the network or the same machine.

Bundler can help compile POMDP specifications, Agents, Loggers, Graphics Clients, or whatever else you need to plug in to the system.
